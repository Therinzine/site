&lt;p>Interested in joining ARC? Attend one of our Fall 2022 callout events during the second week of school.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will discuss the general organization of ARC, as well as some of our past projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The details for these callout events are as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tuesday, August 30th, from 6:00-7:00pm at ARMS B061&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thursday, September 1st, from 6:00-7:00pm at ARMS B061&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As you can see, they both take place in the basement of Armstrong.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Outside of attending the callout, you should join the discord (linked &lt;a href="purduearc.com/join">here&lt;/a>).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
