    Projects are pitched by students at the start of each semester. Following all pitches, the leadership team will
    decide which are worth pursuing.

    Projects often seek collaboration with research professors on campus to ensure they have proper resources and guidance.

    If you are interested in learning on ongoing / past projects, they are all documented on the <a href="/wiki">wiki</a>.
